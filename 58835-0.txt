LIST OF PLATES
"Good," said Glenarvan, "wash the dirty thing and bring it into the cabin." 	p. 13.
The fragments soon strewed the table, and several pieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew them out carefully. 	p. 17.
Dumbarton Castle. 	p. 27.
"Please, madam, speak! I am strong against grief, and can hear all." 	p. 33.
"My father, my poor father!" cried Mary Grant, throwing herself at the feet of Lord Glenarvan. 	p. 41.
The Rev. Mr. Morton implored the blessing of Heaven, and commended the expedition to the care of Providence. 	p. 52.
This man, tall, lank, and shriveled, might have been forty years old. He resembled a long, broad-headed nail, for his head was large and thick, his forehead high, his nose prominent, his mouth wide, and his chin blunt. 	p. 57.
Paganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was carried away in the rapid flight of imagination. 	p. 65.
They could scarcely see the city, which was on an elevated plain in the form of a terrace, resting on volcanic rocks three hundred feet in height. The appearance of the island through this rainy curtain was misty. 	p. 73.
Peak of Teneriffe. 	p. 74.
Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves. 	p. 81
Port Famine. 	p. 83.
In Concepcion 	p. 86.
The mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful fellow, and Mulready, were the fortunate ones. 	p. 92.
By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the mountains visible in the distance. 	p. 100.
Two hours more of terrible exertion followed. They kept ascending, in order to reach the highest summit of this part of the mountain. 	p. 108.
The internal rumblings, the din of the avalanche, the crash of the blocks of granite, and the whirlwinds of snow, rendered all communication with each other impossible. 	p. 117.
The bird had raised him by his garments, and was now hovering in mid-air at least one hundred and fifty feet above the encampment. He had perceived the travelers, and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey. 	p. 125.
A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one of the first ledges of the mountain. This individual had broad shoulders, and long hair tied with leathern thongs. 	p. 132.
An important road--that from Carmen to Mendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses, sheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and lay bleaching in the sun. 	p. 144.
They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among the tufts of "paja-brava," a kind of grass that serves the Indians as a shelter during the storms. 	p. 149.
"Poor father!" exclaimed Robert; "how he will thank you when you have found him!" And, so saying, he took his lordship's hand and pressed it to his lips. 	p. 157.
Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed. 	p. 173.
Arriving within range, Paganel fired a blank charge (for he would not needlessly destroy even a bird), and all the flamingoes flew away, while the geographer gazed at them attentively through his glasses. 	p. 181.
In fact, they were a dozen young children and boys who were drilling very nicely. Their uniform consisted of a striped shirt confined at the waist by a leathern girdle. 	p. 185.
"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman," cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. 	p. 188.
More than once during the journey, the attention and interest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of the mirage. 	p. 193.
"The flood! the flood!" replied Thalcave, spurring his horse towards the north. 	p. 201.
A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives with a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a whirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious tide. 	p. 205.
He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and, shaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly. 	p. 208.
Glenarvan, Paganel, the major, Austin, and Mulready were seated astraddle, or dangling in the branches, according to their own inclinations. 	p. 213.
A long body appeared. Paganel dangled from branch to branch. His hands could grasp nothing. Was he alive, or dead? 	p. 217.
The hunt promised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders. 	p. 223.
However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate. The dried meat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast sparrows and hilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered. 	p. 225.
They were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has neither palace nor cottage. 	p. 229.
The incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some, darting perpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six times in the same place; others spread in zigzag lines, and produced on the dark vault of the heavens astonishing jets of arborescent flame. 	p. 233.
In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the ombu, and enveloped it in its watery folds. 	p. 237.
The sound of a horse's hoofs was heard upon the plain, and the tall form of the Indian emerged from the darkness. 	p. 241.
Glenarvan watched alone. He could not convince himself that the Duncan was so near him; but as for supposing that she had not arrived at her appointed rendezvous, it was impossible, for such a ship there were no delays. 	p. 245.
They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was seen through the foam of the waves. 	p. 249.
Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was approaching the ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense. From the deck they endeavored to count those who were returning. 	p. 252.
"My object," said MacNabb, "is not to invalidate the arguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them." 	p. 257.
At sunrise they saw the conical peak of Tristan, seemingly separated from all the rest of the rocky group. 	p. 260.
A few hours of their united toil resulted in the death of a large number of seals who were "caught napping." 	p. 261.
Our friends found a few voluntary exiles on the former island, who, by means of seal-fishing, eke out a scanty existence in this out-of-the-way spot. 	p. 264.
Inasmuch as this was sufficient to cook fish, Paganel decided that it was not necessary for him to bathe here "geographically." 	p. 265.
"Major," said Paganel, "will you wager your rifle against my telescope that I cannot name at least fifty Australian explorers?" 	p. 268.
"Master Robert shall count for us." And forthwith the learned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of the discovery of Australia. 	p. 269.
Then, impelled by the hurricane, the billows outran her; they leaped over the taffrail, and the whole deck was swept with tremendous violence. 	p. 276.
"Let go!" cried the young captain. The barrels were inverted, and from their sides streamed floods of oil. 	p. 280.
As the boats containing the whole of the party were rowed ashore, they felt that the fate of their father would soon be probably decided. 	p. 284.
A fair and comfortable locality, which the merry mill crowned with its pointed gable and caressed with the moving shadow of its sails. 	p. 288.
He was a somewhat rough-looking, broad-shouldered man, of about forty-five. 	p. 292.
"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling down the jib, the Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia, which was not two cable-lengths distant." 	p. 293.
When he came to himself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the interior of the country. 	p. 296.
At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a comfortable livelihood. 	p. 297.
This business being settled, the party returned on board. 	p. 305.
The vehicle was a cart twenty feet long and covered with an awning, the whole resting upon four wheels, without spokes, felloes, or tires. 	p. 308.
Ayrton and Olbinett took their places respectively in front and in the rear part of the cart, while Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, Robert, Captain Mangles, and the two sailors, mounted their horses. 	p. 312.
The "Mosquito Plains," whose very name describes them, and serves to tell of the tortures that our friends had to encounter. 	p. 313.
Red-gum Station, the home and settlement of an emigrant engaged in the cattle-breeding which is the source of so much Australian wealth. 	p. 316.
The major was skillful enough to shoot a very rare bird,--a "jabiru," or giant crane. This creature was five feet high; and its broad, black, sharp conical beak measured eighteen inches in length. 	p. 317.
A crack was heard; the cart inclined at an alarming angle; the water reached the feet of the ladies, and the whole vehicle threatened to give way. It was an anxious moment. 	p. 324.
After dinner the traveling party had, as if in anticipation, seated themselves at the foot of a magnificent banksia; the young moon was rising high into the heavens, lengthening the twilight, and prolonging it into the evening hour. 	p. 325.
"When I am dead, place a pistol in my right hand, and leave me without burial." His forebodings were realized, and the next morning he died. 	p. 328.
He beheld the waters of the Indian Ocean, and proudly unfurled the Australian flag from the topmost branch of the highest tree he could find. 	p. 329.
A terrible accident had occurred, not a collision, but a running off the track and a fall into the river, which was filled with the fragments of cars and locomotives. 	p. 333.
In the midst of the multitude two men were bearing a corpse. It was that of the guard, already cold. A poniard-thrust had pierced him to the heart. 	p. 337.
A boy of eight years, with a notice pinned to the back of his jacket which read as follows: "Toliné, to be conducted to Echuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid." 	p. 340.
Paganel and the others had now gathered round, and Toliné had to answer many a question. He came out of his examination very creditably. 	p. 341.
In the streets, in connection with the strange sign-boards and announcements, the novel erections and purposes to which some of them were adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary for every one. 	p. 344.
Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be seen specimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold has been found. 	p. 345.
Anon you might see him as in the illustration, when he had picked up a pebble and was sure that it was in itself so interesting as a mineralogical specimen that he must treasure it up for the Bank of France. 	p. 348.
They were like so many columns exactly mated, and could be counted by hundreds. 	p. 352.
At evening they encamped at the foot of some trees that bore the marks of a recent fire. They formed tall chimneys, as it were, for the flames had hollowed them out internally throughout their entire length. 	p. 353.
Of these miserable beings there were about thirty, men, women, and children, dressed in ragged kangaroo-skins. 	p. 360.
A sham fight, which lasted about ten minutes, the women urging on the combatants and pretending to mutilate those who fell in the fray. 	p. 361.
Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder, guarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better resist sleep. 	p. 364.
Here, for the first time, they saw the menure, or lyre-bird, whose tail has the form of the graceful instrument of Orpheus. 	p. 368.
It was a charming house of wood and brick, surrounded by clusters of plants, and had the elegant form of a Swiss cottage. 	p. 372.
Of all the sports of the day the most interesting was unquestionably a kangaroo hunt. 	p. 376.
